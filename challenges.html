      <p class="lead">We found communicating fairly easy as we have Microsoft teams and discord to talk. We found
        implementing the main features difficult as it required a lot of coding and time. We have been stretched for
        time as it has taken a lot of time to implement the main features and write the report as well as doing
        research. A challenge we were expecting is that it would be very time consuming to code everything, put it in a
        webpage, research how to implement the features and then find solutions to the coding problems. To address this
        and overcome them we have just worked hard and put in a lot of time and effort. We have learned and developed
        the skill to improve our coding abilities and report writing skills. No plans changed we stuck to our roles and
        work and executed pretty well. Our timetable was pretty good, we all put in a lot of work and time, some more
        than others but we all put in a significant amount of time and effort, we believe that our timetable was
        realistic as we got all our work done week.
