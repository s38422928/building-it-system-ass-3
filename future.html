      <p class="lead">Our team started off with the idea of an app related to study or productivity because of the very
        well-known struggles associated with studying and university life. During a brainstorm session, the popular
        website Kahoot! was briefly mentioned. It is basically an online quiz game: an admin provides the users with a
        code that can be used to join a room. Inside it, a question followed by four flashcards appear on screen under a
        timer and whoever gets the rights answers faster wins. However, the application was greatly gamified and
        resulted in students who are not serious to ruin the learning experienced for the other students. Not only did
        this hinder the learning process for the students but also distracted the teachers from focusing on class.
        Another application that the team had a look at was Piazza which allows students to sign up and participate in
        quizzes with the team. However, the application does not let a student sign up without a valid classroom. This
        results in the students being unable to sign up and practice without being a part of a class. That proved to be
        the inspiration that kick started the project and set us off with the idea of educational quizzes facilitated by
        the use of flashcards, which answers could be uploaded by students or lecturers, progress measured, content
        voted and synced with universities content and course structures. </p>
