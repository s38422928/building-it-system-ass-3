    <h1 class="display-4">What have you learned about group projects? What has worked well in your group? What hasn't
      worked well?</h1>
    <p class="lead">One thing that we have learned about group projects is that we are all exposed to many different
      perspectives and views of project processes and what the end product may look like. Having group members with
      different perspectives and views of how we should approach the project meant for us that we would each discuss our
      own goals and processes of what we would like to do as a group and then we would collectively decide as a group
      what would be the most realistic pathway and result that would allow for everyone to contribute relatively equally
      and would align with everybody’s goals. Another thing that we have learned from being in a group project is that
      communication is key. Without establishing a line of communication between all group members then the projects
      processes and end goals with become blurry and likely unobtainable. If group members are unable to communicate
      between each other then assigning individual work will become difficult and then clashing can happen where
      multiple group members do the same piece of work without notifying each other or even if it is just one group
      member that is out of the loop can create an imbalance of assigned individual work completion. This can create
      setbacks for the group as the schedule can become disorientated and the end goal may be unachievable by the due
      date. In addition if communication cannot be established then the work that is to be completed can become one
      sided as some members may not do the work required and other members may need to pick up the slack creating an
      imbalance of contribution and can then lead to disruption and anger amongst group members creating an unhealthy
      and inefficient environment. One thing that has worked really well in our group is that we have good communication
      amongst all group members. When presented with an assignment our group would have several meetings on Microsoft
      teams discussing it, assigning individual work, setting our end goals, going through the rubric and assignments
      specifications. Once we have our individual work assigned, we would have regular meetings which is where we would
      discuss our progress and any changes we should make. We also have a team discord server where we usually ask each
      other questions about the assignment work and give daily updates of what we may have just completed when doing
      work. Another thing that has worked well in our group is that we have a diverse group in that we have people with
      different skills that can cover each base of what the assignment requires of us and where everybody can play to
      their strengths. We have group members that are better at programming than others and they take on the role of
      programming the aspects of the assignments and then we have group members that are better suited for the report
      component of the assignments such as project background, diagrams, project progresses and future development.
      Having a group of people with diverse skills allows us to split the project work well as people can do what they
      enjoy and excel at and it is good that we are not one sided where everybody for example wants to do the
      programming component of the assignment which allows us to distribute the work relatively easily without conflict.
      Another thing that worked well for us is that we all got along pretty well which can be a major issue for some
      groups however for us that was not a problem. We were all able to communicate well in and out of meetings and
      complete our work well together and individually on the components of the assignment without any conflict between
      any group members. One thing that may not have worked too well for us is our organisation and time management.
      Although we do eventually complete our assignment work, some of us if not most usually will leave it until the
      last week to do the majority of the work. Usually this happens not because of laziness or attitude but usually it
      is because of other assignments that are due before the assignments for this course which usually take priority
      due to time constraints, so we could probably work on our organisational skills and time management skills.
      Usually we end up working long hours and are still working on key components of the assignment very close to when
      the assignment is due and end up submitting it just a couple of hours before the deadline which probably is not
      too good for results and the end goals which is something we need to improve upon. </p>

    <h1 class="display-4">What use did you make of your Mentor? What use did you make of your Lecturer in guiding you?
      What were the group processes for communication? How effective were they? Have there been any changes since the
      start of the semester? </h1>
    <p class="lead">We found that our mentor was very helpful in directing us in achieving our assignment progresses and
      our end goals. During our practicals our mentor would give the group advice on the assignment and while each group
      was presenting their assignment work to the class and mentor, the mentor would give feedback to each group and
      some advice on what else they should be doing which we found really useful in going about our work in the future
      and seeing what else we could implement into our project. Our mentor was also readily available to have a meeting
      out of the practical with the group where we could ask question about the assignment specifications that needed
      additional clarification and how we should go about our work and how to achieve the marks. Also, we could present
      to the mentor the work we were unsure about and gain additional input which helped us map a pathway towards a
      completed project. Our primary platform of communication is Microsoft teams where we would have regular meeting to
      discuss our roles in the assignment. We also use it to upload our work to each other so we can all view the work
      that everybody has completed and then put the assignment together. Additionally, we also use discord to send each
      other updates of our daily progresses in our assigned individual work and also other tasks within the course.
      Microsoft team and discord have been extremely effective in communicating and keeping up to date with each other.
      We use Microsoft teams to mainly assign work and roles to each group member as well as discuss major progress in
      the project as we keep everybody up to speed with our timeline and tasks. Discord has been used to keep up
      communication daily as it is very convenient and easy to use, this allows us to stay in contact between group
      meeting without losing focus and clarity on what is going on with the project and everything else around the
      course. No there have not been any changes since the start of the semester, we have kept it pretty consistent, we
      meet on teams regularly to discuss assignment specifications, assign work, upload work and discuss major updates,
      changes and completion of work and then we use discord to keep up daily as explained previously. That is what we
      have been doing consistently all semester. </p>

    <h1 class="display-4">From your experience in this project, what is the most important aspect of organizing a
      project of this nature? Is there anything that you would do differently if you were to start again? </h1>
    <p class="lead">The most important aspect of organizing a project is a consistent line of communication in our
      opinion. Without communication the project will fall apart and the end goal will not be achieved. If a consistent
      and constant line of communication is not established between all group members then there can be work left
      incomplete, roles and work not assigned, multiple members can end up completing the same work instead that effort
      could have been put to other unfinished work, updates and changes will not be conveyed to all group members and
      members can become confused, uninformed and angry with creates an inefficient and unhealthy working environment,
      without communication then the project will not be complete to a high standard. If we were to do something
      differently if we were to start again then it would probably to be more organized, so we do not rush close to the
      deadline. </p>

    <h1 class="display-4">What advice would you give to a group about to embark on a similar project? </h1>
    <p class="lead">The advice we would give to a group about to embark on a similar project is to establish roles and a
      line of communication. When starting a project, they would need to go through the project specifications together
      and then assign each group member their role in the pathway to completing the assignment and achieving the end
      goal as well as assign individual group work to each member. Also establishing a platform where the group can
      communicate together on a convenient platform daily and can give each other updates. In addition, we believe that
      the group should set deadlines for themselves to have work completed by in order to stay on top of the overall
      work and not be overwhelmed close to the deadline of the complete assignment.
