            <hr class="my-4">
            <p>At beginning of the project we decided to have a Covid tracking map, it is a map that could shows how the people who have a affected by Covid-19 are distributed, and it will alarm the user to not go to some high risk location, because we think
                that during this covid-19, the program like this is what people or government needed. However, after a week of research and the advice from the lecturer. We found out that this project is existed, and there is less innovation that we could
                do for it. After the discussion and consideration, we decided to give up this idea and move to the other. Come back to deciding a topic, we are finally getting idea from a quiz website, which does not give us a good user experience, we
                believe that a quiz project have a good amount of potential users and since we are students, we understand what user what to have, therefore without a long discussion we decided to have quiz project, we call it Quizzzaris. After the we
                decided our topic, we quickly move to the plaining phase, First we should have a prototype of our website so that we could see that weather our topic could have a nice user experiences or not, and spend a few hours to make sure the basic
                content of the website, and we move to the second step which having use case, in order to increase the usability and good user interface, we have to make sure that in whatever situation or in whatever operation the website could still
                makes the user feel comfortable, and provide the service that the users wants to have, so we draw a wireframe, as well as the designing some advance feature, since there are many0 existed website, we have to differentiate our website with
                the other, and at least we are not going to makes the user feel disappointed. On the other hand, with the coding part, our teams using flask to build up the website. And we are updating their skill by learning some new coding technique
                online. However a big challenge for us is that we actually never get in touch with flask before so our teams need to put a huge amount of time in learning the coding, also the feature that we set up is actually quite challenging because
                of we have to differentiate it with other website, we actually need to fixing the bugs quite frequently.

            <p>The outcomes for our project include 5 features.
                <br> 1. Doing quizzes <br>2. Adding questions and answers <br>3. Score display <br>4. Solution discussion <br>5. Rating system.<br> Doing quizzes would require being able to access the site and the existing quizzes, selecting from pre-existing
                options, progress through the quiz and finish. Adding questions required being able to save quiz questions and answers, displaying the quizzes and matching questions to solutions. Score display would show the user their score and display
                graphs on what percentage of questions in an area they answered correctly. Solution discussion involves listing and editing comments, being able to reply to comments, viewing comments and matching comments to solutions/quizzes. Rating
                system would require listing rating, aggregating ratings and allowing certain users to rate Due to changes throughout the project, score and discussion features were moved to extended features and replaced by login and profile. <br><br>3.1
                Login requires saving user details and restricting access to certain areas based on login status. <br>4.1 Profile allows users to edit their profile information and details.<br> We will be able to demonstrate 4 out of the 5 features: doing
                quizzes, adding questions and solutions, login and profile. Whilst these features are demonstrable, there are facets to these that are incomplete or subpar in functionality. Feature 1 does not always progress through the quiz questions
                when attempting to do the quiz and has some visual display issues. Feature 4.1 currently has limited areas users can edit. Feature 2 and 3 have full functionality. We expected to be able to implement a simple rating system of sorts but
                due to complexities with feature 1 and 2, there was little time to focus on implementing feature 5. In addition, the tools and technology used for these features were unfamiliar to most of our members which posed an added difficulty in
                realising the features. In addition, feature 1 relies on a well formatted interface to implement, making it hard to check for full functionality. <br><br>Screenshots

            <hr class="my-4">
            <p>Since we get the different idea for the project, we completely change the scope of the project, however even with the new idea that we are doing now the scope has changed a bit over the course of the project. Our initial ideas were for an
                interactive quiz site with which lets users attempt quizzes and receive feedback in the form of score comparison and comments/discussion section underneath a quiz’s solutions. During the run of the project, it became apparent that a comments
                section was difficult to implement. As such, it was moved to be an extended feature, replaced with a core feature of user login. The login feature would be fundamental in the approach to create the extended feature of user comment creation
                and discussion. <br> We did not experience much in terms of scope creep but there were some areas that had to be trimmed an some features had to have their functions reduced.

            <p>At the beginning of the assignment we actually know that if we just following what people doing on other quiz website will reducing our workload, however this will also reduce the unique feature of our website and it might getting problem
                with the copyright. In the next couple of time we are achieving

            <p class="lead">Testing</p>
            <hr class="my-4">
            <p>We plan to give the test to the users once we finish the basic design of the websites(by the mockups),the users will be friends of our team members and also random people online , it is mainly involve the form of present the quiz with the
                way of answer the quiz the and the satisfaction of user design of the project. Once we receive the requirements from the users we will start working on the implementation. <br> Once we finish the coding, we will start the second test.
                For this time, we will testing the function of the database, and check whether the website having bug or not, it is a must for the website to not crush when we are using it. We will also checking out the usability again due to the real
                situation, because compare with mockups, in real website will performs different during complex environments.

            <p>1.For the team communication and time management and documentation: <br> As our project needs to be developed by our teams, tools that help the co-working will be important for us. Therefore to achieve a high efficiency working Status, here
                is the tools that we use for co-working: <br> Microsoft Teams: Microsoft teams provide a communication function with posting the message on our group and allow the team members to reply, we are also will be able to send the document on
                to the group channel which reduces the time for getting updated data from our team members. <br> Trello: Trello is a Kanban board that allows teams to add the schedule on it, and also allows the teams to comment on the Kanban. <br> Discord:
                Discord is a simple program that we use for contact with our team members, also it is what we usually use in our life, therefore we much prefer to use it as daily communication. <br>
