      <h1 class="display-4">Motivation </h1>
      <p class="lead">Our team started off with the idea of an app related to study or productivity because of the very
        well-known struggles associated with studying and university life. During a brainstorm session, the popular
        website Kahoot! was briefly mentioned. It is basically an online quiz game: an admin provides the users with a
        code that can be used to join a room. Inside it, a question followed by four flashcards appear on screen under a
        timer and whoever gets the rights answers faster wins. However, the application was greatly gamified and
        resulted in students who are not serious to ruin the learning experienced for the other students. Not only did
        this hinder the learning process for the students but also distracted the teachers from focusing on class.
        Another application that the team had a look at was Piazza which allows students to sign up and participate in
        quizzes with the team. However, the application does not let a student sign up without a valid classroom. This
        results in the students being unable to sign up and practice without being a part of a class. That proved to be
        the inspiration that kickstarted the project and set us off with the idea of educational quizzes facilitated by
        the use of flashcards, which answers could be uploaded by students or lecturers, progress measured, content
        voted and synced with universities content and course structures. </p>

        <h1 class="display-4">Aims and goals </h1>
        <p class="lead">Our team aimed to create a website application that allows users to take quizzes. To
          differentiate this from other quiz apps, we wanted to make the quiz app a community and user driven app. This
          would include features such as being able to comment on solutions to quiz questions and to be able to create
          quizzes for others to use.

          This can be broken down into a several goals. Our main goal is to be able to have a functional interface where
          we can visually see the different aspects of the quiz app such as the quiz names, the login page, the logo
          etc. Whilst having functional features is important, without an interface to view them would result in lack of
          visible branding and no deliverable product to the end user.

          Another goal is for our team to liaise with each other on a consistent basis to ensure smooth project
          progression and address problems as they appear. This also allows for small tweaks to the design to be bought
          up and addressed as soon as possible and hopefully avoid scope creep. This is also an important goal to focus
          on as we are all working remotely from each other which increases communication issues.

          A secondary aim is to have a basic level of security and user privilege present to prevent people from
          spamming content and as a soft filter to prevent irrelevant or inappropriate content from being added into the
          system.

          Scope

          Our scope for the project is to be able to produce a basic level of the quiz app that includes the core
          functions of doing and adding quizzes. This includes smaller aspects such as a working interface, questions
          and solutions being logged in a database for a quiz and being able to log in to create quizzes. </p>
